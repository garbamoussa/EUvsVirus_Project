# Digital Platform 

## Inspiration

We are inspired by the SME's unmet financing gap of $5.2 trillion according to world Bank data in the developing countries, 90 % contribution to global business, 50% global employment, and 40% of global GDP.

## What it does

The system can provide an accurate overview of SME's status with the right financial needs and assign a solution to each SME in a crisis like this. The model will base on Data science, digital finance, machine learning, financial solidity. The system will be linked to SME's national data source for the creation of SMEs Data System in a user-friendly Mobile-App with high privacy. The can analyze SME's data individually (e.g. 2019 and 2020 1st quarter financial status), categorize them, clustering of risk, identifying each specific needs and the system can tell you the right solution to each need.

## How I built it

We gathered a team of volunteers, led by an experienced research expert in Data Science, Digital finance, App development, machine learning. Together, we will build SME data systems and recommendation mobile apps for Android, back end servers, and predictive engines based on the concept of Machine learning.

## Challenges I ran into

Working on and implementation of a complex system with diverse teams of developers, data scientists, specialists, and designers from different academic backgrounds and fields.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
